Here are some code and the projects I made during my journey through [Udacity & Bertelsmann Data Science Scholarship](https://www.udacity.com/bertelsmann-data-scholarships). 

## Challenge Phase

[r-and-python-in-rmarkdown](https://github.com/TianaQ/udacity-bertelsmann-ds-challenge/tree/master/0-challenge-phase/r-and-python-in-rmarkdown) - an example of combining R and Python in one Rmarkdown document, made for a forum discussion. 
>See [output in html](https://tianaq.github.io/udacity-bertelsmann-ds-challenge/0-challenge-phase/r-and-python-in-rmarkdown/r_and_python_in_rstudio.html)

[ubdsc-group-projects](https://github.com/TianaQ/ubdsc-group-projects) - files and scripts created for group project activities. Some exploration analysis was conducted on Boston fires data. The analysis of marketing freelancers offering their services online was submitted as a group project.

## Data Foundations Nanodegree

[DFND Syllabus](https://github.com/TianaQ/udacity-bertelsmann-ds-challenge/blob/master/0-challenge-phase/dfnd-syllabus.pdf) | [DFND Certificate](https://confirm.udacity.com/LKPNGKYZ)

After the challenge phase I was accepted to the full scholarship but due to the sorting process got into Data Foundations Nanodegree (recently rebranded as [Business Analytics Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/business-analytics-nanodegree--nd098)). It took me 5 days to finish it so after the graduation I was granted an upgrade to Data Analyst Nanodegree. Here are the topics covered and the projects I made for DFND.

[dfnd-descriptive-stats](https://github.com/TianaQ/udacity-bertelsmann-ds-challenge/tree/master/1-dfnd-descriptive-stats) - the project required using __spreadsheets__ to practice __descriptive statistics__ and analyse Udacity students survey data. 
>See [Survey analysis report](https://github.com/TianaQ/udacity-bertelsmann-ds-challenge/blob/master/1-dfnd-descriptive-stats/survey__presentation.pdf)

[dfnd-sql](https://github.com/TianaQ/udacity-bertelsmann-ds-challenge/tree/master/2-dfnd-sql) - the project required applying __SQL__ to explore data in Chinook sample database. I used RMarkdown and R to combine queries with data exploration, the output included in the final presentation can be seen [here](https://tianaq.github.io/udacity-bertelsmann-ds-challenge/2-dfnd-sql/project_sql_output.html).
>See [Music SQL database analysis report](https://github.com/TianaQ/udacity-bertelsmann-ds-challenge/blob/master/2-dfnd-sql/Music%20SQL%20Database%20Analysis.pdf)

DFND __Tableau__ project can be found [here](https://public.tableau.com/profile/tatiana.kurilo#!/vizhome/RegionalDifferencesinUSA/RegionalDifferencesintheUSA). The project uses the data of US Census 2015 to visualise regional differences in the United States in terms of population, income, labor markets, commute time, etc.

## Data Analyst Nanodegree

[DAND Syllabus](https://github.com/TianaQ/udacity-bertelsmann-ds-challenge/blob/master/0-challenge-phase/dand-syllabus-v7.pdf) | [DAND Certificate](https://confirm.udacity.com/59GCM2E6)

[dand-sql](https://github.com/TianaQ/udacity-bertelsmann-ds-challenge/tree/master/3-dand-sql) - the project required applying __SQL__ to obtain data for chosen cities from the database of average temperatures in the student workspace as .csv files, and describing the trends. I recreated the database locally for selected data to conduct EDA in R and produce the report using RMarkdown.
>See [Weather trends report](https://tianaq.github.io/udacity-bertelsmann-ds-challenge/3-dand-sql/weather_trends.html)

[dand-intro-to-python](https://github.com/TianaQ/udacity-bertelsmann-ds-challenge/tree/master/4-dand-intro-to-python) - the project required to investigate US Bikeshare data using __Python basics__: lists, dictionaries, sets, writing functions, using libraries, etc.
>See [US Bikeshare data analysis](https://tianaq.github.io/udacity-bertelsmann-ds-challenge/4-dand-intro-to-python/Bike_Share_Analysis.html)

[dand-data-investigation](https://github.com/TianaQ/udacity-bertelsmann-ds-challenge/tree/master/5-dand-data-investigation) - the project required applying the methods of __exploratory data analysis__ to the chosen data from [Gapminder.org](https://www.gapminder.org/), using __Python libraries__ - `pandas`, `numpy` and `matplotlib`. 
>See [Maternal mortality data investigation project](https://tianaq.github.io/udacity-bertelsmann-ds-challenge/5-dand-data-investigation/Investigate_a_Dataset.html)

[dand-practical-stats](https://github.com/TianaQ/udacity-bertelsmann-ds-challenge/tree/master/6-dand-practical-stats) - the program included two projects which required __statistics__ methods applications for __hypothesis testing__, the project structure was pre-set in both cases.
>See [A/B testing project](https://tianaq.github.io/udacity-bertelsmann-ds-challenge/6-dand-practical-stats/AB_testing.html) and [Stroop effect analysis](https://tianaq.github.io/udacity-bertelsmann-ds-challenge/6-dand-practical-stats/perceptual_phenomenon.html)

[dand-EDA-in-R](https://github.com/TianaQ/udacity-bertelsmann-ds-challenge/tree/master/7-dand-eda-in-r) - the project required performing exploratory data analysis on a chosen data set, using __R__ programming language. Data visualisations are created with `ggplot2` library.
>See [Prosper loans exploration report](https://tianaq.github.io/udacity-bertelsmann-ds-challenge/7-dand-eda-in-r/prosper_loans.html)

[dand-data-wrangling](https://github.com/TianaQ/udacity-bertelsmann-ds-challenge/tree/master/8-dand-data-wrangling) - the project required applying the methods of __data gathering, assessing and cleaning__ to the data from [@dog_rates](https://twitter.com/dog_rates) Twitter account, using __Python__, and performing exploratory data analysis on the cleaned data. 
> See [WeRateDogs data wrangling project](https://tianaq.github.io/udacity-bertelsmann-ds-challenge/8-dand-data-wrangling/wrangle_act.html)

DAND __Tableau__ project can be found [here](https://public.tableau.com/views/ProsperLoansDataVizProject/FinalStory). It is based on exploratory analysis of Prosper's loans data, which was the project for EDA in R course (see above). Tableau project write-up is available [here](https://tianaq.github.io/udacity-bertelsmann-ds-challenge/9-dand-data-storytelling/Tableau_Story.html).
