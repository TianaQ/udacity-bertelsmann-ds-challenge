Here are some code and the projects I made during my journey through Udacity & Bertelsmann Data Science Scholarship.

## Challenge Phase

[r-and-python-in-rmarkdown](https://github.com/TianaQ/udacity-bertelsmann-ds-challenge/tree/master/0-challenge-phase/r-and-python-in-rmarkdown) - an example of combining R and Python in one Rmarkdown document, made for a forum discussion. 
>See [output in html](https://tianaq.github.io/udacity-bertelsmann-ds-challenge/0-challenge-phase/r-and-python-in-rmarkdown/r_and_python_in_rstudio.html)

[ubdsc-group-projects](https://github.com/TianaQ/ubdsc-group-projects) - files and scripts created for group project activities. Some exploration analysis was conducted on Boston fires data. The analysis of marketing freelancers offering their services online was submitted as a group project.

## Data Foundations Nanodegree

After the challenge phase I was accepted to the full scholarship but due to the sorting process got into Data Foundations Nanodegree (recently rebranded as [Business Analytics Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/business-analytics-nanodegree--nd098)). It took me 5 days to finish it so after the graduation I was granted an upgrade to Data Analyst Nanodegree. Here are the topics covered and the projects I made for DFND.

[dfnd-descriptive-stats](https://github.com/TianaQ/udacity-bertelsmann-ds-challenge/tree/master/1-dfnd-descriptive-stats) - the project required using __spreadsheets__ to practice __descriptive statistics__ and analyse Udacity students survey data. 
>See [Survey analysis report](https://github.com/TianaQ/udacity-bertelsmann-ds-challenge/blob/master/1-dfnd-descriptive-stats/survey__presentation.pdf)

[dfnd-sql](https://github.com/TianaQ/udacity-bertelsmann-ds-challenge/tree/master/2-dfnd-sql) - the project required applying __SQL__ to explore data in Chinook sample database. I used RMarkdown and R to combine queries with data exploration, the output included in the final presentation can be seen [here](https://tianaq.github.io/udacity-bertelsmann-ds-challenge/2-dfnd-sql/project_sql_output.html).
>See [Music SQL database analysis report](https://github.com/TianaQ/udacity-bertelsmann-ds-challenge/blob/master/2-dfnd-sql/Music%20SQL%20Database%20Analysis.pdf)

DFND __Tableau__ project can be found [here](https://public.tableau.com/profile/tatiana.kurilo#!/vizhome/RegionalDifferencesinUSA/RegionalDifferencesintheUSA). The project uses the data of US Census 2015 to visualise regional differences in the United States in terms of population, income, labor markets, commute time, etc.



## Data Analyst Nanodegree

[DAND Syllabus](https://github.com/TianaQ/udacity-bertelsmann-ds-challenge/blob/master/0-challenge-phase/dand-syllabus-v7.pdf) | [DAND Certificate](https://confirm.udacity.com/59GCM2E6)

[dand-sql](https://github.com/TianaQ/udacity-bertelsmann-ds-challenge/tree/master/3-dand-sql) - the project required applying SQL to obtain data for chosen cities from the database of averade temperatures in student workspace as .csv files, and describing the trends. I recreated the database locally for selected data to conduct EDA in R and produce the report using RMarkdown.
